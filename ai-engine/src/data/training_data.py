This paradox has caused timeline Alpha-7 to split into three unstable branches, each exhibiting increasingly erratic physical laws. Civilizations within these branches report strange phenomena: reversed gravity wells, technology that functions only during specific temporal phases, and individuals who exist simultaneously across multiple points in time. As reality continues to fracture, the other Architects must decide whether to stabilize these distortions, exploit them for power, or allow them to potentially collapse entire timelines into the void."
