```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chronocore.git
cd chronocore
```

2. Install dependencies and start the development environment

#### Using Docker (recommended for full-stack development)
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

#### Manual Setup (for individual component development)

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at https://game-frontend-7455.onrender.com

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
The backend API will be available at https://game-ujiz.onrender.com

**AI Engine**
```bash
cd ai-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
The AI Engine will be available at https://game-ai-engine.onrender.com

**Mobile App**
```bash
cd mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Database Setup

**PostgreSQL**
```bash
# Create the database
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE chronocore;"

# Run migrations (from backend directory)

cd ai-engine
python -m pytest
```

## Game Overview

### Theme
A multidimensional timeline-based game where players are Architects of Reality, manipulating time, ethics, and technology to shape civilizations across alternate futures.

### Key Features
1. **Multiverse Board System**: Modular and expandable board made of hexagonal tiles representing different timelines and realms.
2. **Ethical Dilemmas**: Face moral choices that affect your karma score and the stability of the multiverse.
3. **Technology Research**: Develop technologies that grant special abilities and advantages.
4. **AI-Generated Storytelling**: Dynamic quests and narratives generated based on game state and player actions.
5. **Real-time Multiplayer**: Play with friends in real-time with Socket.IO integration.

### Player Roles
- **Techno Monk**: Spiritual tech leaders who excel at research and timeline stabilization.
  - Special Ability: Can stabilize timelines at a reduced cost.
  - Starting Bonus: +2 to all research actions.

- **Shadow Broker**: Ethical hackers who manipulate information and resources.
  - Special Ability: Can see hidden information about realms.
  - Starting Bonus: Begin with extra resource cards.

- **Chrono Diplomat**: Peacekeepers who excel at navigating between timelines.
  - Special Ability: Can move between non-adjacent realms once per turn.
  - Starting Bonus: +1 karma at the start of the game.

- **Bio-Smith**: Genetic eco-engineers who specialize in realm development.
  - Special Ability: Can upgrade realms at a reduced cost.
  - Starting Bonus: Start with one pre-developed realm.

### Game Mechanics

#### Turn Structure
1. **Movement Phase**: Move your character to a different realm.
2. **Action Phase**: Perform one of the following actions:
   - Gather resources from the current realm
   - Research a technology
   - Build or upgrade a structure
   - Stabilize the current realm
   - Complete a quest
3. **Event Phase**: Resolve any events or ethical dilemmas.

#### Karma System
Karma is a central mechanic that reflects the ethical choices made by players:
- Positive karma actions: Helping other players, stabilizing timelines, resolving ethical dilemmas positively
- Negative karma actions: Sabotaging other players, destabilizing timelines for personal gain

#### Technology Tree
Players can research technologies across four categories:
- **Temporal**: Improves movement and timeline manipulation
- **Ethical**: Enhances karma gain and provides ethical insights
- **Material**: Increases resource production and efficiency
- **Biological**: Improves realm development and population growth

### Victory Conditions
Win by reaching Equilibrium, defined as:
- Minimum karma: +10 or higher
- Owning 4+ developed realms
- Having at least 3 timeline connections
- Resolving one major Timeline Rift event

### AI Integration
The game features advanced AI integration through our custom AI engine:
